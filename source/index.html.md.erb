# Introduction

> **API endpoint**

```
<%= config[:api_endpoint] %>/
```

> Examples in this documentation are written using curl.

The Tito API is designed to be a predictable and intuitive interface for secure programmatic access to Tito.

The Tito API is a REST API and returns JSON responses.

We hope by providing an API it will allow developers to build cool and useful tools on top of Tito.

# Authentication

```shell
curl --request GET \
  --url '<%= config[:api_endpoint] %>/...' \
  --header 'Authorization: Token token=<%= config[:api_token] %>' \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
```

The Tito API uses API tokens to allow users to authenticate without exposing their credentials.

Developers can find their API token by signing in at [https://id.tito.io](https://id.tito.io). API tokens are
**private** tokens and should not be shared with unauthorized parties. API tokens
can be regenerated by clicking on the `Regenerate API Token` button at [https://id.tito.io](https://id.tito.io).

Your API token needs to be included in the `Authorization` header so your requests can be authenticated.

The Tito API also provides detailed information about [Authentication Errors](#errors-authentication-errors).
