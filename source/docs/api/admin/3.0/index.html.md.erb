# Introduction

> **Admin API endpoint**

```
<%= config[:api_endpoint] %>/
```

> Examples in this documentation are written using curl.

The Admin API is designed to be a predictable and intuitive interface for secure programmatic access to Tito.
The Admin API can be used to manage events, tickets, etc.

The Admin API is a REST API and returns JSON responses.

We hope by providing an API it will allow developers to build cool and useful tools on top of Tito.

# Authentication

The Admin API uses API tokens to allow users to authenticate without exposing their credentials.

Developers can generate an API token by signing in at [https://id.tito.io](https://id.tito.io/api-access-tokens) and selecting
`Generate New Token`.

As the Admin API is a private API, only `secret` API token types can be used. As well as selecting a token type, a mode
must also be selected:

* `live` - Use this mode once your event has gone live. This mode will only return `tickets` and `registrations` from the live
mode.
* `test` - Use this mode to test your API integration is working. You can continue to use this token after your event has gone live and
it will only read and write test data without affecting your live data. Note this mode will only return test `tickets` and `registrations`.

If you find your API token has been compromised it can be [revoked](https://id.tito.io/api-access-tokens) and a new one generated.

Your API token needs to be included in the `Authorization` header so your requests can be authenticated.

### Confirm you can connect

```shell
curl --request GET \
  --url '<%= config[:api_endpoint] %>/hello' \
  --header 'Authorization: Token token=<%= config[:api_token] %>' \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
```

```json
{
    "authenticated": true,
    "access_token": "*ab1C",
    "lookup_mode": "live",
    "accounts": [
        "biscuit-box",
        "demo"
    ]
}
```

This endpoint will confirm you are authenticated properly and tell you which accounts you have access to.

`<%= "GET #{config[:api_endpoint]}/hello" %>`

The `access_token` is the last four characters of whatever access token you have used.

The Admin API also provides detailed information about [Authentication Errors](#errors-authentication-errors).

# Headers

All API requests must send the following request headers:

* `Authorization` with the value `Token token=<%= config[:api_token] %>` where `<%= config[:api_token] %>` is replaced with your API token.
* `Accept` header with the value of `application/json`
