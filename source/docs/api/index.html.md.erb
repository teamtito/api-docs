# Welcome

The Tito API is divided into the following components:

The **<a href='/docs/api/admin/'>Admin API</a>** is the API that powers our admin dashboard.

The **<a href='/docs/api/checkout/'>Checkout API</a> (coming in 2019)** is what powers our event registration, via our widget.

The **<a href='/docs/api/checkin/'>Check-in API</a>** powers our mobile and web-based check-in apps.

Using any combination of the three APIs, you can leverage and build on the entire feature-set of Tito in your own apps.
