We've released [version 3.1 of our Admin API](/docs/api/admin/3.1) in beta.

The aim of version 3.1 is simplicity and speed.

### No nested resources by default

In version 3.0, if you asked for a `registration` then you got all its `tickets` too (as well `line_items`, `payment`, `receipt`, `receipts`, and `refunds`). But if you don't need all those other resources then it just makes the response bigger and slower. In version 3.1 you just get the resource you asked for unless you explicitly "expand" other resources.

For example, to get a single registration:

```
https://api.tito.io/v3/:account/:event/registrations/:slug
```

To get its tickets too:

```
https://api.tito.io/v3/:account/:event/registrations/:slug?expand=tickets
```

You can expand multiple resources:

```
https://api.tito.io/v3/:account/:event/registrations/:slug?expand=tickets,receipts
```

### Same view

In version 3.0, you got an "extended" view of a resource if you asked for a single resource and a "short" view of a resource if you asked for a list. In version 3.1, you get the same view regardless. The `view` option has been replaced with the more flexible `expand` option.

### Choosing a version

You can choose which version you want to use in two ways:

- Set your access token to a specific version
- Send a `version` parameter in the URL

For example:

```
https://api.tito.io/v3/:account/:event/registrations/:slug?version=3.1
```

The URL setting will override the access token setting.

### Using `id` and `slug`

In version 3.0 we had attributes like `release_ids` that would actually return you an array of slugs. Now, if you ask for ids you get integers as you would expect. Where possible, we also offer the slugs too, e.g. `release_slugs`.

### Meta data

In version 3.0, we attached a `meta` attribute to every list. In version 3.1, all responses include it. Some additional information is also added to it:

- `api_version`
- `expandable` â€” a list of possible expansions for this resource and whether they are expanded or not.

If you try and use the `view` parameter or if you choose an expansion that is not available, then you will also see a `warning` attribute that tells you about that.

For example:

```json
{
    "ticket": {
        "_type": "ticket",
        "id": 123,
        ...
        "registration": {
          "_type": "registration",
          "id": 106,
          ...
        }
      }
    },
    "meta": {
        "api_version": "3.1.0",
        "expandable": {
            "activities": false,
            "answers": false,
            "opt_ins": false,
            "registration": true,
            "release": false,
            "responses": false
        }
    }
}
```

When we return the `metadata` for an [event](https://ti.to/docs/api/admin#events), [release](https://ti.to/docs/api/admin#releases), [registration](https://ti.to/docs/api/admin#registrations) or [ticket](https://ti.to/docs/api/admin#tickets) we now return an object rather than a JSON string. So instead of seeing `"metadata": "{\"foo\":\"bar\"}"` you will see `"metadata":{"foo":"bar"}"`.
