## 6th March 2019

### Modified

When we return the `metadata` for an [event](https://ti.to/docs/api/admin#events), [release](https://ti.to/docs/api/admin#releases), [registration](https://ti.to/docs/api/admin#registrations) or [ticket](https://ti.to/docs/api/admin#tickets) we now return an object rather than a JSON string. So instead of seeing `"metadata": "{\"foo\":\"bar\"}"` you will see `"metadata":{"foo":"bar"}"`.

## 29th January 2019

### Modified

* Creating a registration with [this endpoint](/docs/api/admin/#registrations-create-a-registration) no longer sends out emails unless you pass in `notify = true`.
