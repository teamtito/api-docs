# Pagination

Pass `?page=N` to `tickets`, `answers` and `checkins` for pagination.

The following returns a JSON of all tickets on page one:

`GET <%= config[:checkin_api_endpoint] %>/checkin_lists/:checkin_list_slug/tickets?page=1`


Pagination information for `tickets`, `answers` and `checkins` can be retrieved by fetching the check-in list. The total number of pages for each paginated resource is specified by the following attributes:

* `total_pages` (deprecated) - the total number of pages of tickets.
* `total_ticket_pages` - the total number of pages of tickets.
* `total_checkin_pages` - the total number of pages of check-ins.
* `total_answer_pages` - the total number of pages of answers.

Each page is limited to a maximum of 1000 items.
