# Events

Events are planned social occasions that tickets will be sold for and people will attend.

An Event belongs to an `Account` and most other resources belong to an event.

An event URL is comprised of the combination of the `account_slug` and the `event_slug`.

For example `https://ti.to/ultimateconf/<%= Date.today.year %>` is composed:

* The base `ti.to` URL
* The Ultimate Conf `Account` slug `ultimateconf`
* The specific `Event` slug for the <%= Date.today.year %> edition.

The equivalent event can be looked up using a similar URL structure with the API base URL:

`<%= config[:api_endpoint] %>/ultimateconf/<%= Date.today.year %>`

  url: "#{config[:api_endpoint]}/:account_slug/:event_slug"

## Duplicate an Event

<%= partial "includes/requests/post",

  }
%>
<%= partial "includes/admin_api/events/duplication.json" %>

`<%= "POST #{config[:api_endpoint]}/:account_slug/:event_slug/duplication" %>`

* `account_slug` - The `slug` attribute of an `Account`.
* `event_slug` - The `slug` attribute of an `Event` to be duplicated.

As duplicating an `Event` happens asynchronously the Tito API provides a response
indicating the current `status` of the duplication:

* `processing` - The duplication is still being processed.
* `complete` - The duplication has successfully completed.

The latest status of the duplication can be then looked up.

## Duplicate an Event status

<%= partial "includes/requests/get",
  locals: {
    url: "#{config[:api_endpoint]}/:account_slug/:event_slug/duplication"
  }
%>
<%= partial "includes/admin_api/events/duplication_complete.json" %>

The latest status of the `Event` duplication.

`<%= "GET #{config[:api_endpoint]}/:account_slug/:event_slug/duplication" %>`

* `account_slug` - The `slug` attribute of an `Account`.
* `event_slug` - The `slug` attribute of an `Event` to be duplicated.

As duplicating an `Event` happens asynchronously the API provides the ability to
lookup the latest status of the duplication. The status can be either:

* `processing` - The duplication is still being processed.
* `complete` - The duplication has successfully completed.

Once the duplication completes the Event `slug` and `title` will be assigned.
