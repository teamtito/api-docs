# Views

We have two views on the data we return:

* Short
* Extended

### Short

This is what you get if you ask for a list of records (e.g. [Get all Registrations](#registrations-get-all-registrations)) then we give you the "short" view of the data, so that we can make the response as quick as possible and you don't get a lot of data all at once.

### Extended

If you ask for a single record (e.g. [Get a Registration](#registrations-get-a-registration)) then we give you the "extended" view which gives you more detailed information and possible associated records.

### Choosing the view

You can override this by passing the `view` parameter. For example:

`<%= "GET #{config[:api_endpoint]}/:account_slug/:event_slug/tickets?view=extended" %>`

*Please note* — if you ask for the extended view of a large list of records it might take a long time and you might get a lot of data.
