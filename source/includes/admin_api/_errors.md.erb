# Errors

```json
{
  "errors": {
    "title": [
      "can't be blank"
    ]
  }
}
```

The Tito API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate errors, and
includes more detailed information on the exact nature of an error in the HTTP
response.

For example, if a resource requires the `title` attribute to be present there
will be an `errors` key in the response with subkey of `title` containing an array
of errors.



## HTTP Status Codes

Code | Meaning
---- | -------
`200` OK | All is well.
`201` Created | Your request has been fulfilled and has resulted in one or more new resources being created.
`204` No Content | Your request has been fulfilled and that there is no additional content to send in the response payload body. e.g. deleting a resource.
`401` Unauthorized | Your request is not authenticated. See the [Authentication Errors](#errors-authentication-errors) section for more information.
`403` Forbidden | Your request is not authorized as the has user insufficient permissions. See the [Authorization Errors](#errors-authorization-errors) section for more information.
`404` Page Not Found | The endpoint requested does not exist.
`422` Unprocessable Entity | The resource couldn't be created or updated due to a validation error. Please see the response body for more information.
`429` Too Many Requests | Your application is exceeding its rate limit. Slow down, pal!

## Authentication Errors

```json
{
  "errors": {
    "api_token": [
      "is blank"
    ]
  },
  "hint": "You can retrieve your API token at https://id.tito.io. Please see the API docs for further information."
}
```

If a request cannot be authenticated the Tito API returns the standard
`401` unauthorized HTTP status code and includes more details of the
authentication error in the HTTP response.

## Authorization Errors

```json
{
  "errors": {
    "status": 403,
    "title": "Forbidden",
    "detail": "You are not authorized to access refunds"
  }
}
```

If a request cannot be authorized as a user has insufficient permissions
the Tito API returns a `403` forbidden HTTP status code and includes more details of the
authorization error in the HTTP response.

The Tito API includes a machine readable `errors` key. It also has a `hint` key
containing human friendly information on how to resolve your authentication error.
