# Errors


```json
{
  "status": 422,
  "message": "A readable message that describes the problem"
}
```

If you get an error then it will follow a common format. Every error includes a `status` and a `message`.

<%= list_attributes({
  status: {
    description: "The HTTP status code.",
    type: "integer",
    read_only: true
  },
  message: {
    description: "Describes the problem.",
    type: "string",
    read_only: true
  },
  errors: {
    description: "A hash of each attribute and an array of messages for that attribute.",
    type: "object",
    read_only: true
  },
  error_list: {
    description: "Similar to `errors` but in an array.",
    type: "object array",
    read_only: true
  },
  identifier: {
    description: "If we have logged this error then this unique identifier will help us find it in our logs.",
    type: "string",
    read_only: true
  },
  hint: {
    description: "Guidance on what to do to solve this problem.",
    type: "string",
    read_only: true
  },
}, context: :errors) %>

## Authentication errors [401]

<%= display_response "401", resource: :errors %>

If a request cannot be authenticated the Tito API returns the standard
`401` unauthorized HTTP status code and includes more details of the
authentication error in the HTTP response.

The Tito API includes a machine readable `errors` key. It also has a `hint` key
containing human friendly information on how to resolve your authentication error.

## Authorization errors [403]

<%= display_response "403", resource: :errors %>

If a request cannot be authorized as a user has insufficient permissions
the Tito API returns a `403` forbidden HTTP status code and includes more details of the
authorization error in the HTTP response.

## Resource not found [404]

<%= display_response "404", resource: :errors %>

If the resource you are looking for isn't there.

## Validation errors [422]

<%= display_response "422", resource: :errors %>

For example, if a resource requires the `title` attribute to be present there
will be an `errors` key in the response with subkey of `title` containing an array
of errors.

The errors are repeated in an array called `error_list` which you might find easier.
