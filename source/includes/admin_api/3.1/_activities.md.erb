# Activities

<% set_resource :activities %>

Activities represent things that attendees can go to during your event
that are not part of their ticket e.g. bowling or conference dinner.

Tickets can have multiple activities attached, allowing you to share capacity,
set start and end dates and times, sell single and combo tickets for multi-day
events, and show a schedule and itinerary to attendees.
