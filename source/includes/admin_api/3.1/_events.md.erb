# Events

<% set_resource :events, slug: true %>

An Event belongs to an `Account` and most other resources belong to an event.

An event URL is the combination of the `account_slug` and the `event_slug`.

For example `https://ti.to/ultimateconf/<%= Date.today.year %>` is composed:

* The base `ti.to` URL
* The Ultimate Conf `account` slug `ultimateconf`
* The specific `event` slug for the <%= Date.today.year %> edition.

The equivalent event can be looked up using a similar URL structure with the API base URL:

`<%= config[:api_endpoint] %>/ultimateconf/<%= Date.today.year %>`

## Attributes <%= icon_for :attributes %>

<%= show_doc :attributes %>

## Expansions <%= icon_for :expansions %>

<%= show_doc :expansions %>

## Get all upcoming events <%= icon_for :index %>

<%= show_doc :index %>

## Get all Past Events <%= icon_for :index %>

Where the `end_date` is in the past.

<%= show_url "events/past" %>
<%= show_url_key "events/past" %>

## Get all Archived Events <%= icon_for :index %>

Where the event is `archived`.

<%= show_url "events/archived" %>
<%= show_url_key "events/archived" %>

## Get an event <%= icon_for :show %>

<%= show_doc :show %>

## Create an event <%= icon_for :create %>

<%= show_doc :create %>

## Update an event <%= icon_for :update %>

<%= show_doc :update %>

## Delete an event <%= icon_for :delete %>

<%= show_doc :delete %>

## Duplicate an event

<%= show_url "duplication", method: :post %>
<%= partial "includes/admin_api/3.0/events/duplication.json" %>
<%= show_url_key "POST duplication" %>

As duplicating an `Event` happens asynchronously the Tito API provides a response
indicating the current `status` of the duplication:

* `processing` - The duplication is still being processed.
* `complete` - The duplication has successfully completed.

The latest status of the duplication can be then looked up.

## Duplicate an event status

<%= show_url "duplication", method: :get %>
<%= partial "includes/admin_api/3.0/events/duplication_complete.json" %>
<%= show_url_key "duplication" %>

The latest status of the `Event` duplication.

As duplicating an `Event` happens asynchronously the API provides the ability to
lookup the latest status of the duplication. The status can be either:

* `processing` - The duplication is still being processed.
* `complete` - The duplication has successfully completed.

Once the duplication completes the Event `slug` and `title` will be assigned.
