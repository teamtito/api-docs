## Attributes <%= icon_for :attributes %>

## Get all tickets <%= icon_for :index %>

<%= show_doc :index %>

### Sort Order

The default order is by `created_at` with newest tickets first. You can change the order by appending some parameters to the endpoint URL. This is the same as the default:

`?search[sort]=created_at&search[direction]=desc`

The direction can either be `asc` or `desc`.

You can sort on the following attributes:

* `first_name`
* `last_name`
* `created_at`
* `updated_at`
* `price`
* `reference`
* `number`

### Filtering

You can filter which tickets you get back too.

#### By state

For instance, to only get `incomplete` or `unassigned` tickets:

`?search[states][]=incomplete&search[states][]=unassigned`

Possible states are:

* `complete`
* `incomplete`
* `unassigned`
* `void`

By default, the list will exclude `void` tickets. If you want void tickets then you have to explicitly ask for them.

There are some other pseudo-states that behave a little differently.

* `changes_allowed` (only show tickets that allow changes)
* `changes_locked` (only show tickets that have changes locked)

If you select both `changes_allowed` and `changes_locked` then that's effectively the same as saying "those tickets that are either locked or not locked" which is the same as the default.

* `archived` (tickets belonging to an archived release)

The list excludes archived tickets by default. If you select this state then it also includes archived tickets _as well_ as non-archived tickets.

#### By type

`?search[types][]=manual`

Possible types are:

* `manual` - added manually
* `standard` - ordered by customer

#### By release

`?search[release_ids][]=early-bird`

where "early-bird" is the release `slug`.

#### By activity

`?search[activity_ids][]=1025351`

where "1025351" is the activity `id`.

#### By time

This will show all tickets created since 1 Jan 2019 at 9am UTC:

`?search[created_at][gt]=2019-01-01T09:00:00+UTC`

That operator can be:

* `gt` - greater than
* `gte` - greater than or equal to
* `lt` - less than
* `lte` - less than or equal to

And you can do that on the following attributes

* `created_at`
* `updated_at`

So, for instance, to find all tickets that have been updated in the last hour:

`?search[updated_at][gt]=2019-01-01T09:00:00+UTC`

(where you obviously change that timestamp to be one hour ago).

Note: if you don't use the `+UTC` suffix on those timestamps it will default to the time zone used by the event itself.

#### By any text

You can also search by text, which uses the same logic as the dashboard UI:

* email
* name
* phone number
* slug
* reference
* company name
* tag

For example:

`?q=Alice`

## Get a ticket <%= icon_for :show %>

<%= show_doc :show %>

## Create a ticket <%= icon_for :create %>

<%= show_doc :create %>

## Update a ticket <%= icon_for :update %>

<%= show_doc :update %>

## Reassign a Ticket

<%= partial "includes/requests/post",
  locals: {
    url: "#{config[:api_endpoint]}/:account_slug/:event_slug/tickets/:ticket_slug/reassignments",
    parameters: {
      reassignment: {
        email: "jane@example.com",
        first_name: "Jane",
        last_name: "Smith",
        delete_answers: true
      }
    }
  }
%>
<%= partial "includes/admin_api/3.0/reassignments/create.json" %>

Reassign a `Ticket` to a new attendee. It's different from just updating the email and name for a ticket: reassigning a ticket also sends out an email to the new attendee and (optionally) deletes all the answers made by the original attendee.

<%= show_url_key "POST tickets/:ticket_slug/reassignments" %>

### Parameters

<%= list_write_attributes :email, :first_name, :last_name, :delete_answers %>

### Emails Sent

The following people receive an email after a reassignment:

* the new attendee
* the orderer (if their email is different to the original email for this ticket)
* the organisers (if they have chosen to receive notifications)

## Void a Ticket

<%= partial "includes/requests/post",
  locals: {
    url: "#{config[:api_endpoint]}/:account_slug/:event_slug/tickets/:ticket_slug/void",
    parameters: {
      void: {
        resell: true
      }
    }
  }
%>
<%= partial "includes/admin_api/3.0/voids/create.json" %>

Void a `Ticket` so that it is no longer able to be used to [checkin](/docs/api/checkin) to an event.

<%= show_url_key "POST tickets/:ticket_slug/void" %>

### Parameters

<%= list_write_attributes :resell %>

If the `Release` `quantity` is defined (i.e. the number of tickets for that release is limited) then you also need to pass in the `resell` parameter.

For instance, if you have 19/20 tickets sold and you void one and you pass `"resell":true` then it will show 18/20 tickets sold and two will now be available.

If you pass `"resell":false` then it will show 18/19 tickets sold and only one will be available.

If the `Release` `quantity` is not defined (i.e. the number of tickets available is infinite) then the `resell` parameter is optional.
