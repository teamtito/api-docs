# Check-in Lists

<% set_resource :checkin_lists, slug: true %>

Check-in Lists allow you to check your attendees in at the venue of your event.

Create a master check-in list for all attendees or create special lists just for particular ticket types.

Activities represent things that attendees can go to during your event
that are not part of their ticket e.g. bowling or conference dinner.

Tickets can have multiple checkin_lists attached, allowing you to share capacity,
set start and end dates and times, sell single and combo tickets for multi-day
events, and show a schedule and itinerary to attendees.
