# Errors

The Tito API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate errors, and includes more detailed information on the exact nature of an error in the HTTP response.


For example, if a resource requires a name to be present:

<code>
{
  "errors": {
    "name": [
      "can't be blank"
    ]
  }
}
</code>


Code | Meaning

`200` OK | All is well.
`201` Created | The request has been fulfilled and has resulted in one or more new resources being created.
`204` No Content | The request has been fulfilled and that there is no additional content to send in the response payload body. e.g deleting a resource.
`404` Page Not Found | The endpoint requested does not exist.
