# Pagination

Endpoints which enumerate objects are paginated.

Pagination information is returned in the `meta` attribute in the response body.

* `current_page` - The current page number.
* `next_page` - The next page number.
* `prev_page` - The previous page number.
* `total_pages` - The number of pages.
* `total_count` - The number of records with filtering applied,
* `per_page` - The number of results returned in each page.
* `overall_total` - The overall number of records without any filtering applied.

A specific page can be retrieved by providing the `page` parameter:

`<%= "#{config[:api_endpoint]}:account_slug/:event_slug/activities/:activity_id?page=2" %>`
